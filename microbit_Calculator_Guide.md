## Test your calculator
### press button A to move the numbers down and button B to move the numbers up. Select your first operand and press the logo button to enter. Press buttons A or B to cycle through the operations. Select your operation and press the logo to enter. Now select your second operand by pressing button A or B and press enter to solve your equation. Your answer will apear or scroll on the screen. The micro:bit is now ready for a new calculation.
